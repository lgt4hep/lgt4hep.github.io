Dr. Lin is a Taiwanese-American physicist and an American Physics Society Fellow since 2022.  She designed the phone game <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsSOvHgcZww">Quantum 3</a>, which is free to download from the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/quantum-3/id1406630529">Apple App Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gellab.quantum3">Google Play store</a>, and co-creator and manager of <a href="https://sites.google.com/msu.edu/phy480905/home">My Journey as a Physicist</a>.  She received her PhD from Columbia University in the City of New York. She was a postdoctoral fellow in the theory division at Jefferson Lab, a research assistant professor at the University of Washington, and visiting assistant professor at the University of California, Berkeley, before joining Michigan State University. She uses supercomputers to calculate the quark and gluon structure of baryons and mesons, such as their charges, form factors and parton distributions. She loves her research, because experiments around the world from the LHC to nuclear and neutrino physics can leverage the work to explore the frontiers of fundamental physics. She received an NSF Early-Career Award for her work and was one of the 25 recipients of 2020 Cottrell Scholar Awards. She was a former member of Executive Committees for USQCD (2020-2022) and active member for the APS Division of Nuclear Physics (2022-2024).

She received her Ph.D. in 2014 from the University of Washington in Seattle, and was a post-doc research associate at Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Center for Theoretical Physics from 2014-2017, before joining the physics department at the University of Maryland, College Park in 2017 as a faculty. The focus of her research is simulating complex systems in nature arising from the most fundamental particles and interactions underlying them, or their effective descriptions, using classical and quantum computing methods.</p>

<img src="people/WDetmold-150.jpg" border="0" style="padding:0px 10px 20px 10px; float:left">
<p style="clear:both">Professor Detmold's research interests are in strong interaction dynamics in theoretical particle and nuclear physics. Detmold uses analytic methods and supercomputers to solve the complex equations of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) that describe the strong interaction and seeks to understand the emergence of hadrons and nuclei from the underlying Standard Model of particle physics. He aims to determine the properties and interactions of these systems from first principles to confront experiment and to make predictions for regimes such as in the interior of neutron stars where experiments are not possible.</p>

Aida El-Khadra is a professor of physics at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Her research is in theoretical particle physics, where she works on the development of lattice field theory as a precision tool to quantify the nonperturbative effects of Quantum Chromodynamics needed for the interpretation of measurements in high energy experiments. She pursues a broad program of lattice QCD calculations in flavor physics, with a recent focus on the hadronic corrections to the muon's anomalous magnetic moment. She is a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the American Physical Society, as well as a recipient of a Simons Fellowship in Theoretical Physics, a Fermilab Distinguished Scholar appointment, a Sloan Foundation Research Fellowship, among other honors. She currently chairs the Steering Committee of the Muon g-2 Theory Initiative.</p>
