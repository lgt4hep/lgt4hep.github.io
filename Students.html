<h4>Genessa Benton(she/her) </h4>
<p>Department of Physics<br>
University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign<br><br>
Genessa is a first year graduate student studying physics at UIUC. She is interested in doing precision calculations with lattice QCD, and is involved in the theory initiative for the muon anomalous magnetic moment. Outside of physics, she enjoys tennis, Pokémon, and her cat Julie.
</p>

<h4>Akhil Chauhan (he/him)</h4>
<p>Department of Physics<br>
University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign<br><br>
Akhil is a graduate student at the University of Illinois pursuing a PhD in physics. His work focuses on high precision determinations using lattice QCD, such as CKM matrix elements from semileptonic decays and the strong coupling at the Z pole. In his free time, Akhil enjoys book clubs, cooking new dishes, and physical activities with his friends.  </p>	
<br>
<img src="people/NieMiera_150.jpg" border="0" style="padding:0px 10px 20px 10px; float:left">
<h4>Alex NieMiera (she/her) </h4>
<p>Department of Physics and Astronomy <br>
Michigan State University<br><br>
Alex is a first year graduate student pursuing her PhD in physics at Michigan State University, and she is also interested in pursuing the dual PhD degree in computational mathematics, science, and engineering. She enjoys volunteering for events hosted by the Women and Minorities in the Physical Sciences at MSU to help build community within the physics department and hopes to contribute more on this front in the coming years. For her long-term career goals, she hopes to work at a National Lab one day, focusing on research while mentoring student interns. In her free time, she enjoys restoration projects, reading classic literature, and her two cats.
</p>

<br>
<img src="people/Wang-150.jpeg" border="0" style="padding:0px 10px 20px 10px; float:left">
<h4>Sherry Wang (she/her) </h4>
<p>Department of Physics<br>
University of Maryland, College Park<br><br>
Sherry is a first-year physics PhD student at the University of Maryland, College Park. As a member of Professor Zohreh Davoudi's research group, she is studying the applications of quantum thermodynamics to high energy physics. The goal of her current project is to show that local and non-local formulations of gauge theory give rise to the same thermodynamic quantities. As an undergraduate at Northwestern University, she also worked with Dr. Joshua Isaacson and Professor André de Gouvêa to improve the identification of tau neutrino events using the ACHILLES lepton-nucleus event generator. Broadly, her research interests include the applications of novel computational tools, such as quantum computing and machine learning, to fundamental physics.</p>
